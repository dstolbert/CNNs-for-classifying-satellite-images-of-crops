# CNNs-for-classifying-satellite-images-of-crops

This was my first exploration of TensorFlow, Keras, and image processing in general. I used a nice and clean dataset from Kaggle that can be found here- https://www.kaggle.com/fpeccia/weed-detection-in-soybean-crops

You will see that I also apply transfer learning via the VGG16 model. With very little training this model ends up performing extremely well on the task.
